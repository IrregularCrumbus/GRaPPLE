This repository contains the source code and files that I'll use to create my game called GRaPPLE, a futuristic movement shooter!



To play the demo versions that I release:

1) Install Godot 3.1.1; newer versions of Godot are difficult to use. You can download godot 3.1.1 below.
https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.1.1/

WINDOWS USERS will install Godot_v3.1.1-stable_win32.exe.zip or Godot_v3.1.1-stable_win64.exe.zip, depending on their processor.
MAC OS USERS will install Godot_v3.1.1-stable_osx.64.zip
LINUX USERS can probably figure it out themselves. I dunno which one of these works for Linux.

2) Download this source code and place it anywhere in your computer. If you have other Godot projects, be sure to put this project folder there.

3) Use the "Import" button and open up the "project.gd" file that comes with this repository.

4) Open the project. Press the play button at the top of the screen to run the game.

5) ???

6) profit
